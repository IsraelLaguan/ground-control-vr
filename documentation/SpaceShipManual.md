--------------------------------------------

If you are reading this manual it means something has gone wrong with your ship. 

# **DON'T PANIC!**

 Follow the instructions below carefully to resolve your problem with minimal casualties. 

# Ship Layout

  - Each Galactic Hyperion XL5 spacecraft is outfitted with **3 control panels**, each with **2 modules** consisting of **3 widgets**. 
  - Each widget will either be a **toggle switch**, a **knob**, a **button**, or a **slider**
  - *Depending on what  **phase** you are experiencing (1, 2, 3) you will need to address several modules on the panesl, and manipulate the widgets of the modules in a precise manner*
  - When you are certain that you have entered the correct inputs, **hit the initializer button at the front console** to clear that phase
  - If you get the inputs wrong, the ALARM SYSTEM will activate, going from **white** to **orange** to **RED**. You have 3 strikes to get the configuration right across all phases
